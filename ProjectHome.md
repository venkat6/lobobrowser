The Lobo Project

The Lobo Project aims to develop an extensible browser and RIA platform written completely in Java that not only supports HTML and Javascript, but also enables rendering of arbitrary Rich Internet Application (RIA) languages. The Lobo Project consists of the following efforts.
HTML Renderer & Parser Effort (Cobra)
The Cobra effort aims to produce a pure Java HTML parser and rendering engine with support for CCS2 and Javascript.

Java Web Browser Effort (Lobo)
Lobo is our web browser and RIA platform. It relies on Cobra to provide the HTML rendering capabilities of the browser. The Lobo effort itself aims to produce a general-purpose and extensible browser that can render content other than HTML.

JavaFX Integration and Other Efforts
Lobo ships with an extension that can render JavaFX Script and Java source code, in much the same way HTML is supported.
